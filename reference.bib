                  in continuously-valued traits reflects phylogenetic
                  relatedness. Measures of phylogenetic signal are widely used
                  in ecological and evolutionary research, and are recently
                  gaining traction in viral evolutionary studies. Standard
                  estimators of phylogenetic signal frequently condition on data
                  summary statistics of the repeated trait observations and
                  fixed phylogenetics trees, resulting in information loss and
                  potential bias. To incorporate the observation process and
                  phylogenetic uncertainty in a model-based approach, we develop
                  a novel Bayesian inference method to simultaneously estimate
                  the evolutionary history and phylogenetic signal from
                  molecular sequence data and repeated multivariate traits. Our
                  approach builds upon a phylogenetic diffusion framework that
                  model continuous trait evolution as a Brownian motion process
                  and incorporates Pagel's λ transformation parameter to
                  estimate dependence among traits. We provide a computationally
                  efficient inference implementation in the BEAST software
                  package. We evaluate the synthetic performance of the Bayesian
                  estimator of phylogenetic signal against standard estimators,
                  and demonstrate the use of our coherent framework to address
                  several virus-host evolutionary questions, including virulence
                  heritability for HIV, antigenic evolution in influenza and
                  HIV, and Drosophila sensitivity to sigma virus infection.
                  Finally, we discuss model extensions that will make useful
                  contributions to our flexible framework for simultaneously
                  studying sequence and trait evolution.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: The analysis of long reads or the assessment of
                  assembly or target capture data often necessitates running
                  alignments against reference genomes or gene sets. The aligner
                  outputs are often parsed automatically by scripts, but many
                  kinds of analysis can benefit from the understanding that can
                  follow human inspection of individual alignments.
                  Additionally, diagrams are a useful means of communicating
                  assembly results to others. RESULTS: We developed Alvis, a
                  simple command line tool that can generate visualisations for
                  a number of common alignment analysis tasks. Alvis is a fast
                  and portable tool that accepts input in a variety of alignment
                  formats and will output production ready vector images.
                  Additionally, Alvis will highlight potentially chimeric reads
                  or contigs, a common source of misassemblies. CONCLUSION:
                  Alvis diagrams facilitate improved understanding of assembly
                  quality, enable read coverage to be visualised and potential
                  errors to be identified. Additionally, we found that splitting
                  chimeric reads using the output provided by Alvis can improve
                  the contiguity of assemblies, while maintaining correctness.},

                  natalensis, has been assumed to be the sole host of LASV. We
                  found evidence that LASV is also hosted by other rodent
                  species: the African wood mouse Hylomyscus pamfi in Nigeria,

                  Phylogenetic analyses of viral genes coding for glycoprotein,

                  reservoir host the multimammate rodent Mastomys nataliensis,

                  outbreaks of Lassa fever (LF). The World Health Organization
                  has recently declared Lassa virus (LASV) as a priority
                  pathogen for accelerated research leading to a renewed
                  international effort to develop relevant animal models of
                  disease and effective countermeasures to reduce LF morbidity
                  and mortality in endemic West African countries. A limiting
                  factor in evaluating medical countermeasures against LF is a
                  lack of well characterized animal models outside of those
                  based on infection with LASV strain Josiah originating form
                  Sierra Leone, circa 1976. Here we genetically characterize
                  five recent LASV isolates collected from the 2018 outbreak in
                  Nigeria. Three isolates were further evaluated in vivo and
                  despite being closely related and from the same spatial /
                  geographic region of Nigeria, only one of the three isolates
                  proved lethal in strain 13 guinea pigs and non-human primates

                  pathogenesis characteristics in the NHP model, most notably
                  respiratory failure, not commonly described in hemorrhagic
                  cases of LF. These results suggest that there is considerable
                  phenotypic heterogeneity in LASV infections in Nigeria, which
                  leads to a multitude of pathogenesis characteristics that
                  could account for differences between subclinical and lethal
                  LF infections. Most importantly, the development of disease
                  models using currently circulating LASV strains in West Africa
                  are critical for the evaluation of potential vaccines and

                  greatest risks to public health by the World Health
                  Organization. This severe viral hemorrhagic fever is caused by
                  Lassa virus, a zoonotic pathogen that repeatedly spills over
                  to humans from its rodent reservoirs. It is currently not
                  known how climate change, transformations in land use, and
                  human population growth could affect the endemic area of this
                  virus, currently limited to parts of West Africa. By exploring
                  the environmental data associated with virus occurrence, we
                  show how temperature, precipitation and the presence of
                  pastures determine ecological suitability for virus
                  circulation. We project that regions in Central and East
                  Africa will likely become suitable for Lassa virus over the
                  next decades and estimate that the total population living in
                  areas suitable for Lassa virus may grow from about 100 million
                  to 700 million by 2070. By analysing geotagged viral genomes,
                  we find that in the event of Lassa virus being introduced into
                  a new suitable region, its spread might remain spatially
                  limited over the first decades. Our results highlight how the

                  and Lassa virus was found in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) but not

                  real‐time polymerase chain reaction assay. To characterize the
                  Lassa virus in CSF, the 3.5‐kb S RNA was sequenced. In the S
                  RNA coding sequences, the CSF strain differed between 20\% and
                  24.6\% from all known prototype strains. These data suggest
                  that Lassa virus or specific Lassa virus strains can persist
                  in the central nervous system and thus contribute to
                  neuropathogenesis. Lassa virus infection should be considered

                  studies, the extent to which data accurately describes the
                  viral population is a matter of importance. Multiple factors
                  may influence the accuracy of a dataset, including the
                  quantity and nature of the sample collected, and the
                  subsequent steps in viral processing. To investigate this
                  phenomenon, we sequenced replica datasets spanning a range of
                  viruses, and in which the point at which samples were split
                  was different in each case, from a dataset in which
                  independent samples were collected from a single patient to

                  applied to a single sample before splitting the sample and

                  available for recovering prokaryote and eukaryote genomes from
                  metagenome data, only a limited number of pipelines are
                  designed specifically for viromics analysis. With many
                  viromics tools developed in the last few years alone, it can
                  be challenging for scientists with limited bioinformatics
                  experience to easily recover, evaluate quality, annotate
                  genes, dereplicate, assign taxonomy, and calculate relative
                  abundance and coverage of viral genomes using state-of-the-art
                  methods and standards. Here, we describe Modular Viromics
                  Pipeline (MVP) v.1.0, a user-friendly pipeline written in
                  Python and providing a simple framework to perform standard
                  viromics analyses. MVP combines multiple tools to enable viral
                  genome identification, characterization of genome quality,
                  filtering, clustering, taxonomic and functional annotation,
                  genome binning, and comprehensive summaries of results that
                  can be used for downstream ecological analyses. Overall, MVP
                  provides a standardized and reproducible pipeline for both
                  extensive and robust characterization of viruses from
                  large-scale sequencing data including metagenomes,
                  metatranscriptomes, viromes, and isolate genomes. As a typical
                  use case, we show how the entire MVP pipeline can be applied
                  to a set of 20 metagenomes from wetland sediments using only
                  10 modules executed via command lines, leading to the
                  identification of 11,656 viral contigs and 8,145 viral
                  operational taxonomic units (vOTUs) displaying a clear
                  beta-diversity pattern. Further, acting as a dynamic wrapper,
                  MVP is designed to continuously incorporate updates and
                  integrate new tools, ensuring its ongoing relevance in the
                  rapidly evolving field of viromics. MVP is available at
                  https://gitlab.com/ccoclet/mvp and as versioned packages in
                  PyPi and Conda.IMPORTANCEThe significance of our work lies in
                  the development of Modular Viromics Pipeline (MVP), an
                  integrated and user-friendly pipeline tailored exclusively for
                  viromics analyses. MVP stands out due to its modular design,
                  which ensures easy installation, execution, and integration of
                  new tools and databases. By combining state-of-the-art tools
                  such as geNomad and CheckV, MVP provides high-quality viral
                  genome recovery and taxonomy and host assignment, and
                  functional annotation, addressing the limitations of existing
                  pipelines. MVP's ability to handle diverse sample types,
                  including environmental, human microbiome, and
                  plant-associated samples, makes it a versatile tool for the
                  broader microbiome research community. By standardizing the
                  analysis process and providing easily interpretable results,
                  MVP enables researchers to perform comprehensive studies of
                  viral communities, significantly advancing our understanding

                  improvements in the field of metagenomics, including
                  sequencing technologies, advances in bioinformatics and the
                  development of reference databases, but a one-size-fits-all
                  sequencing and bioinformatics pipeline does not yet seem
                  achievable. In this study, we address the bioinformatics part
                  of the analysis by combining three methods into a three-step
                  workflow that increases the sensitivity and specificity of
                  clinical metagenomics and improves pathogen detection. The
                  individual tools are combined into a user-friendly workflow
                  suitable for analysing short paired-end (PE) and long reads
                  from metagenomics datasets—MetaAll. To demonstrate the
                  applicability of the developed workflow, four complicated
                  clinical cases with different disease presentations and
                  multiple samples collected from different biological sites as
                  well as the CAMI Clinical pathogen detection challenge dataset
                  were used. MetaAll was able to identify putative pathogens in
                  all but one case. In this case, however, traditional
                  microbiological diagnostics were also unsuccessful. In
                  addition, co-infection with Haemophilus influenzae and Human
                  rhinovirus C54 was detected in case 1 and co-infection with
                  SARS-Cov-2 and Influenza A virus (FluA) subtype H3N2 was
                  detected in case 3. In case 2, in which conventional
                  diagnostics could not find a pathogen, mNGS pointed to
                  Klebsiella pneumoniae as the suspected pathogen. Finally, this
                  study demonstrated the importance of combining read
                  classification, contig validation and targeted reference
                  mapping for more reliable detection of infectious agents in
                  clinical metagenome samples.},

  abstract     = {Abstract Lassa virus is the causative agent of a dangerous
                  zoonotic disease distributed in West Africa. A primary
                  reservoir host of Lassa virus is Mastomys natalensis. These
                  mice associate closely with humans and are commonly found in
                  villages. Consequently, previous studies of Lassa virus have
                  focused on rural areas. The prevalence of the virus in large
                  cities has not been studied.We conducted a study in N’Zerekore
                  city, which has a population of approximately 300,000
                  residents. Small mammals were captured during a pilot study in
                  May, and the main study was performed in August 2018. Based on
                  the pilot study, we designed and implemented a stratified
                  random sample to investigate the prevalence of Lassa virus
                  among M. natalensis in N’Zerekore. The total sampling efforts
                  consisted of 45 and 985 trapping nights in May and August,
                  respectively. Samples of rodent tissues were screened for
                  Lassa virus by RT-PCR.In May, we trapped 20 rodents, including
                  19 M. natalensis. Viral RNA was detected in 18 M. natalensis.
                  In August, 149 small mammals were captured, including 43 M.
                  natalensis. The prevalence of Lassa virus among M. natalensis
                  in N’Zerekore was 23.3\% (CI 95\%: 11.8–38.6\%). Sequencing
                  showed that the isolates belonged to lineage IV. We detected
                  four Lassa virus hotspots located in different parts of the
                  city. The largest Lassa virus hotspot was found in the
                  neighborhood of the central market, which suggests that the
                  virus was originally introduced into the city through the
                  market.},

  abstract     = {Mobile detection of Lassa virus Lassa fever is a hemorrhagic
                  viral disease endemic to West Africa. Usually, each year sees
                  only a smattering of cases reported, but hospitalized patients
                  risk a 15\% chance of death. Responding to fears that a
                  10-fold surge in cases in Nigeria in 2018 signaled an
                  incipient outbreak, Kafetzopoulou et al. performed metagenomic
                  nanopore sequencing directly from samples from 120 patients
                  (see the Perspective by Bhadelia). Results showed no strong
                  evidence of a new strain emerging nor of person-to-person
                  transmission; rather, rodent contamination was the main
                  source. To prevent future escalation of this disease, we need
                  to understand what triggers the irruption of rodents into
                  human dwellings. Science, this issue p. 74; see also p. 30 The
                  2018 Nigerian Lassa fever season saw the largest ever recorded
                  upsurge of cases, raising concerns over the emergence of a
                  strain with increased transmission rate. To understand the
                  molecular epidemiology of this upsurge, we performed, for the
                  first time at the epicenter of an unfolding outbreak,
                  metagenomic nanopore sequencing directly from patient samples,
                  an approach dictated by the highly variable genome of the
                  target pathogen. Genomic data and phylogenetic reconstructions
                  were communicated immediately to Nigerian authorities and the
                  World Health Organization to inform the public health
                  response. Real-time analysis of 36 genomes and subsequent
                  confirmation using all 120 samples sequenced in the country of
                  origin revealed extensive diversity and phylogenetic
                  intermingling with strains from previous years, suggesting
                  independent zoonotic transmission events and thus allaying
                  concerns of an emergent strain or extensive human-to-human

                  hemorrhagic fever that is endemic in the countries of Nigeria,
                  Sierra Leone, Liberia, and Guinea and perhaps elsewhere in
                  West Africa. To determine the degree of genetic diversity
                  among Lassa virus strains, partial nucleoprotein (NP) gene
                  sequences were obtained from 54 strains and analyzed.
                  Phylogenetic analyses showed that Lassa viruses comprise four
                  lineages, three of which are found in Nigeria and the fourth
                  in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Overall strain variation
                  in the partial NP gene sequence was found to be as high as
                  27\% at the nucleotide level and 15\% at the amino acid level.
                  Genetic distance among Lassa strains was found to correlate
                  with geographic distance rather than time, and no evidence of
                  a "molecular clock" was found. A method for amplifying and
                  cloning full-length arenavirus S RNAs was developed and used
                  to obtain the complete NP and glycoprotein gene (GP1 and GP2)
                  sequences for two representative Nigerian strains of Lassa
                  virus. Comparison of full-length gene sequences for four Lassa
                  virus strains representing the four lineages showed that the
                  NP gene (up to 23.8\% nucleotide difference and 12.0\% amino
                  acid difference) is more variable than the glycoprotein genes.
                  Although the evolutionary order of descent within Lassa virus
                  strains was not completely resolved, the phylogenetic analyses
                  of full-length NP, GP1, and GP2 gene sequences suggested that
                  Nigerian strains of Lassa virus were ancestral to strains from
                  Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. Compared to the New World
                  arenaviruses, Lassa and the other Old World arenaviruses have
                  either undergone a shorter period of diverisification or are
                  evolving at a slower rate. This study represents the first
                  large-scale examination of Lassa virus genetic variation.},

  abstract     = {The 2013-2015 West African epidemic of Ebola virus disease
                  (EVD) reminds us of how little is known about biosafety level
                  4 viruses. Like Ebola virus, Lassa virus (LASV) can cause
                  hemorrhagic fever with high case fatality rates. We generated
                  a genomic catalog of almost 200 LASV sequences from clinical
                  and rodent reservoir samples. We show that whereas the
                  2013-2015 EVD epidemic is fueled by human-to-human
                  transmissions, LASV infections mainly result from
                  reservoir-to-human infections. We elucidated the spread of
                  LASV across West Africa and show that this migration was
                  accompanied by changes in LASV genome abundance, fatality
                  rates, codon adaptation, and translational efficiency. By
                  investigating intrahost evolution, we found that mutations
                  accumulate in epitopes of viral surface proteins, suggesting
                  selection for immune escape. This catalog will serve as a
                  foundation for the development of vaccines and diagnostics.

  abstract     = {Lassa virus is genetically diverse with several lineages
                  circulating in West Africa. This study aimed at describing the
                  sequence variability of Lassa virus across Nigeria and
                  inferring its spatiotemporal evolution. We sequenced and
                  isolated 77 Lassa virus strains from 16 Nigerian states. The
                  final data set, including previous works, comprised metadata
                  and sequences of 219 unique strains sampled between 1969 and
                  2018 in 22 states. Most of this data originated from Lassa
                  fever patients diagnosed at Irrua Specialist Teaching
                  Hospital, Edo State, Nigeria. The majority of sequences
                  clustered with the main Nigerian lineages II and III, while a
                  few sequences formed a new cluster related to Lassa virus
                  strains from Hylomyscus pamfi Within lineages II and III,
                  seven and five sublineages, respectively, were
                  distinguishable. Phylogeographic analysis suggests an origin
                  of lineage II in the southeastern part of the country around
                  Ebonyi State and a main vector of dispersal toward the west
                  across the Niger River, through Anambra, Kogi, Delta, and Edo
                  into Ondo State. The frontline of virus dispersal appears to
                  be in Ondo. Minor vectors are directed northeast toward Taraba
                  and Adamawa and south toward Imo and Rivers. Lineage III might
                  have spread from northern Plateau State into Kaduna, Nasarawa,
                  Federal Capital Territory, and Bauchi. One sublineage moved
                  south and crossed the Benue River into Benue State. This study
                  provides a geographic mapping of lineages and phylogenetic
                  clusters in Nigeria at a higher resolution. In addition, we
                  estimated the direction and time frame of virus dispersal in
                  the country.IMPORTANCE Lassa virus is the causative agent of
                  Lassa fever, a viral hemorrhagic fever with a case fatality
                  rate of approximately 30\% in Africa. Previous studies
                  disclosed a geographical pattern in the distribution of Lassa
                  virus strains and a westward movement of the virus across West
                  Africa during evolution. Our study provides a deeper
                  understanding of the geography of genetic lineages and
                  sublineages of the virus in Nigeria. In addition, we modeled
                  how the virus spread in the country. This knowledge allows us
                  to predict into which geographical areas the virus might
                  spread in the future and prioritize areas for Lassa fever
                  surveillance. Our study not only aimed to generate Lassa virus
                  sequences from across Nigeria but also to isolate and conserve
                  the respective viruses for future research. Both isolates and
                  sequences are important for the development and evaluation of
                  medical countermeasures to treat and prevent Lassa fever, such
                  as diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines.},

  abstract     = {Lassa virus infects hundreds of thousands of people each year
                  across rural West Africa, resulting in a high number of cases
                  of Lassa fever (LF), a febrile disease associated with high
                  morbidity and significant mortality. The lack of approved
                  treatments or interventions underscores the need for an
                  effective vaccine. At least four viral lineages circulate in
                  defined regions throughout West Africa with substantial
                  interlineage nucleotide and amino acid diversity. An effective
                  vaccine should be designed to elicit Lassa virus specific
                  humoral and cell mediated immunity across all lineages. Most
                  current vaccine candidates use only lineage IV antigens
                  encoded by Lassa viruses circulating around Sierra Leone,
                  Liberia, and Guinea but not Nigeria where lineages I-III are
                  found. As previous infection is known to protect against
                  disease from subsequent exposure, we sought to determine
                  whether LF survivors from Nigeria and Sierra Leone harbor
                  memory T cells that respond to lineage IV antigens. Our
                  results indicate a high degree of cross-reactivity of CD8+ T
                  cells from Nigerian LF survivors to lineage IV antigens. In
                  addition, we identified regions within the Lassa virus
                  glycoprotein complex and nucleoprotein that contributed to
                  these responses while T cell epitopes were not widely
                  conserved across our study group. These data are important for
                  current efforts to design effective and efficient vaccine
                  candidates that can elicit protective immunity across all
                  Lassa virus lineages., Lassa virus (LASV), the causative agent
                  of the hemorrhagic illness Lassa fever (LF), is found
                  throughout West Africa. Humans are usually infected after
                  contact with infected rodent excreta or aerosolized virus. The
                  mortality rate among hospitalized LF cases is high and no
                  effective treatments or vaccines exist. A vaccine effective
                  against the four main lineages of LASV is needed to protect
                  susceptible individuals across West Africa. To understand how
                  this protection could occur, we examined the immune responses
                  of LF survivors from two different regions of West Africa. As
                  previous infection with Lassa virus protects from disease
                  after subsequent exposure, the immune response of LF survivors
                  provides a model of protective immunity that could be induced
                  after vaccination. We found that LASV strains from lineages
                  different from those that infected the LF survivors
                  efficiently activated memory CD8+ T cell responses. We
                  identified regions within LASV proteins that elicit memory
                  responses in the majority of individuals. From these data, we
                  propose that an effective vaccine that protects against
                  lineages across West Africa should be designed to elicit
                  memory CD8+ T cell responses in addition to antibody
                  responses.},

  abstract     = {Summary Background There is anecdotal evidence for Lassa virus
                  persistence in body fluids. We aimed to investigate various
                  body fluids after recovery from acute Lassa fever, describe
                  the dynamics of Lassa virus RNA load in seminal fluid, and
                  assess the infectivity of seminal fluid. Methods In this
                  prospective, longitudinal, cohort study we collected plasma,
                  urine, saliva, lacrimal fluid, vaginal fluid, and seminal
                  fluid from Lassa fever survivors from Irrua Specialist
                  Teaching Hospital in Edo State, Nigeria. Inclusion criteria
                  for participants were RT-PCR-confirmed Lassa fever diagnosis
                  and age 18 years or older. Samples were taken at discharge
                  from hospital (month 0) and at months 0·5, 1, 3, 6, 9, 12, 18,
                  and 24 after discharge. The primary objective of this study
                  was to quantitatively describe virus persistence and clearance
                  and assess the infectivity of seminal fluid. Lassa virus RNA
                  was detected using real-time RT-PCR. Infectivity was tested in
                  cell culture and immunosuppressed mice. We used a linear
                  mixed-effect model to analyse the dynamics of virus
                  persistence in seminal fluid over time. Findings Between Jan
                  31, 2018, and Dec 11, 2019, 165 participants were enrolled in
                  the study, of whom 159 were eligible for analysis (49 women
                  and 110 men). Low amounts of Lassa virus RNA were detected at
                  month 0 in plasma (49 [45\%] of 110 participants), urine (37
                  [34\%]), saliva (five [5\%]), lacrimal fluid (ten [9\%]), and
                  vaginal fluid (seven [21\%] of 33 female participants). Virus
                  RNA was cleared from these body fluids by month 3. However, 35
                  (80\%) of 44 male participants had viral RNA in seminal fluid
                  at month 0 with a median cycle threshold of 26·5. Lassa virus
                  RNA remained detectable up to month 12 in seminal fluid.
                  Biostatistical modelling estimated a clearance rate of 1·19
                  log10 viral RNA copies per month and predicted that 50\% of
                  male survivors remain Lassa virus RNA-positive in seminal
                  fluid for 83 days after hospital discharge and 10\% remain
                  positive in seminal fluid for 193 days after discharge. Viral
                  RNA persistence in seminal fluid for 3 months or more was
                  associated with higher viraemia (p=0·006), more severe disease
                  (p=0·0075), and longer hospitalisation during the acute phase
                  of Lassa fever (p=0·0014). Infectious virus was isolated from
                  48 (52\%) of 93 virus RNA-positive seminal fluid samples
                  collected between month 0 and 12. Interpretation Lassa virus
                  RNA is shed in various body fluids after recovery from acute
                  disease. The persistence of infectious virus in seminal fluid
                  implies a risk of sexual transmission of Lassa fever. Funding

                  causes Lassa fever - a lethal hemorrhagic fever. Entry of LASV
                  into the host cell is mediated by the glycoprotein complex
                  (GPC), which is the only protein located on the viral surface
                  and comprised of three subunits: glycoprotein 1 (GP1),
                  glycoprotein 2 (GP2), and a stable signal peptide (SSP). The
                  LASV GPC is a class one viral fusion protein, akin to those
                  found in viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV),
                  influenza, Ebola virus (EBOV), and severe acute respiratory
                  syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2). These viruses are
                  enveloped and utilize membrane fusion to deliver their genetic
                  material to the host cell. Like other class one fusion
                  proteins, LASV-mediated membrane fusion occurs through an
                  orchestrated sequence of conformational changes in its GPC.
                  The receptor-binding subunit, GP1, first engages with a host
                  cell receptor then undergoes a unique receptor switch upon
                  delivery to the late endosome. The acidic pH and change in
                  receptor result in the dissociation of GP1, exposing the
                  fusion subunit, GP2, such that fusion can occur. These events
                  ultimately lead to the formation of a fusion pore so that the
                  LASV genetic material is released into the host cell.
                  Interestingly, the mature GPC retains its SSP as a third
                  subunit - a feature that is unique to arenaviruses.
                  Additionally, the fusion domain contains two separate fusion
                  peptides, instead of a standard singular fusion peptide. Here,
                  we give a comprehensive review of the LASV GPC components and
                  their unusual features.},

                  of a stable-signal peptide, a receptor-binding subunit, GP1,

                  transduction in HAP1-ΔDAG1 cells yet poorly transduced HAP1
                  cells, suggesting that they are involved in αDG utilization.
                  Residues H141, N146, F147, and Y150 cluster at the predicted
                  central core of the trimeric interface and are important for
                  GP-αDG interaction. Additionally, H92A-H93A, 150HA, 172HA, and
                  230HA displayed reduced transduction in both HAP1 and
                  HAP1-ΔDAG1 cells, despite efficient cell-to-cell fusion
                  activity. These mutations may interfere with interactions with
                  the endosomal receptor LAMP1 or interfere at another stage in
                  entry that is common to both cell lines. Insight gained from
                  these data can aid in the development of more-effective entry
                  inhibitors by blocking receptor interactions.IMPORTANCE
                  Countries in which Lassa virus is endemic, such as Nigeria,
                  Sierra Leone, Guinea, and Liberia, usually experience a
                  seasonal outbreak of the virus from December to March.
                  Currently, there is neither a preventative vaccine nor a
                  therapeutic available to effectively treat severe Lassa fever.
                  One way to thwart virus infection is to inhibit interaction
                  with cellular receptors. It is known that the GP1 subunit of
                  the Lassa glycoprotein complex plays a critical role in
                  receptor recognition. Our results highlight a region within
                  the Lassa virus GP1 protein that interacts with the cellular
                  receptor alpha-dystroglycan. This information may be used for
                  future development of new Lassa virus antivirals.},

                  number of people living at risk for this disease calls for the
                  development of a vaccine against Lassa virus (LASV). We
                  generated live-attenuated LASV vaccines based on measles virus
                  and Mopeia virus platforms and expressing different LASV
                  antigens, with the aim to develop a vaccine able to protect
                  after a single shot. We compared the efficacy of these
                  vaccines against LASV in cynomolgus monkeys. The vaccines were
                  well tolerated and protected the animals from LASV infection
                  and disease after a single immunization but with varying
                  efficacy. Analysis of the immune responses showed that
                  complete protection was associated with robust secondary T
                  cell and antibody responses against LASV. Transcriptomic and
                  proteomic analyses showed an early activation of innate
                  immunity and T cell priming after immunization with the most
                  effective vaccines, with changes detectable as early as 2 days
                  after immunization. The most efficacious vaccine candidate, a
                  measles vector simultaneously expressing LASV glycoprotein and
                  nucleoprotein, has been selected for further clinical

                  accelerated development of preventive, diagnostic, and
                  therapeutic interventions. To date, no vaccine has been
                  licensed for LASV. ChAdOx1-Lassa-GPC is a chimpanzee
                  adenovirus-vectored vaccine encoding the Josiah strain LASV
                  glycoprotein precursor (GPC) gene. In the following study, we
                  show that ChAdOx1-Lassa-GPC is immunogenic, inducing robust
                  T-cell and antibody responses in mice. Furthermore, a single

  abstract     = {Background Lassa fever is an acute viral illness characterized
                  by multi-organ failure and hemorrhagic manifestations. Lassa
                  fever is most frequently diagnosed in Nigeria, Sierra Leone,
                  Liberia, and Guinea, although sporadic cases have been
                  recorded in other West African countries, including Mali. The
                  etiological agent of Lassa fever is Lassa virus (LASV), an
                  Arenavirus which is maintained in nature and frequently
                  transmitted to humans by Mastomys natalensis. The purpose of
                  this study was to better define the geographic distribution of
                  LASV-infected rodents in sub-Saharan Mali.
                  Methodologies/Principal Findings Small mammals were
                  live-trapped at various locations across Mali for the purpose
                  of identifying potential zoonotic pathogens. Serological and
                  molecular assays were employed and determined LASV infected
                  rodents were exclusively found in the southern Mali near the
                  border of Côte d'Ivoire. Overall, 19.4\% of Mastomys
                  natalensis sampled in this region had evidence of LASV
                  infection, with prevalence rates for individual villages
                  ranging from 0 to 52\%. Full-length genomic sequences were
                  determined using high throughput sequencing methodologies for
                  LASV isolates generated from tissue samples of rodents
                  collected in four villages and confirmed the phylogenetic
                  clustering of Malian LASV with strain AV.
                  Conclusions/Significance The risk of human infections with
                  LASV is greatest in villages in southern Mali. Lassa fever
                  should be considered in the differential diagnosis for febrile
                  individuals and appropriate diagnostic techniques need to be
                  established to determine the incidence of infection and
                  disease in these regions.},

  abstract     = {Lassa virus (LASV) is endemic in parts of West Africa where it
                  causes Lassa fever (LF), a viral hemorrhagic fever with
                  frequent fatal outcomes. The diverse LASV strains are grouped
                  into six major lineages based on the geographical location of
                  the isolated strains. In this study, we have focused on the
                  lineage II strains from southern Nigeria. We determined the
                  viral sequences from positive cases of LF reported at tertiary
                  hospitals in Ebonyi and Enugu between 2012 and 2016. Reverse
                  transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) showed that
                  29 out of 123 suspected cases were positive for the virus
                  among which 11 viral gene sequences were determined.
                  Phylogenetic analysis of the complete coding sequences of the
                  four viral proteins revealed that lineage II strains are
                  broadly divided into two genetic clades that diverged from a
                  common ancestor 195 years ago. One clade, consisting of
                  strains from Ebonyi and Enugu, was more conserved than the
                  other from Irrua, although the four viral proteins were
                  evolving at similar rates in both clades. These results
                  suggested that the viruses of these clades have been
                  distinctively evolving in geographically separate parts of
                  southern Nigeria. Furthermore, the epidemiological data of the
                  2014 outbreak highlighted the role of human-to-human
                  transmission in this outbreak, which was supported by
                  phylogenetic analysis showing that 13 of the 16 sequences
                  clustered together. These results provide new insights into
                  the evolution of LASV in southern Nigeria and have important
                  implications for vaccine development, diagnostic assay design,
                  and LF outbreak management.},

                  validate multiple probe sets, including one that targets the

                  presumptively identified as Lassa virus (LV) by direct

                  These, and six additional isolates obtained only by titration
                  of supernatant fluids from inoculated Vero cells, were
                  definitively identified as LV in a neutralization test. Two
                  additional LV isolates were obtained from a patient's sera
                  from Nigeria. By cross-neutralization tests, the Nigerian LV
                  strains were serologically identical to the prototype Nigerian
                  LV strain (PP) but were distinct from both a reference LV
                  strain from Sierra Leone (SL), and from the Liberian (LIB)
                  strains isolated in this study. The LIB and SL strains were
                  closely related to each other, but not to the Nigerian LV
                  strains. LIB LV strains were tested for virulence in strain 2
                  and 13 guinea-pigs, and a spectrum of virulence was observed
                  which correlated only approximately with disease severity for
                  human patients. Two human-lethal isolates killed all
                  inoculated strain 2 and 13 guinea-pigs, whereas nine isolates
                  from mildly ill patients were benign for guinea-pigs. Yet some
                  LV isolates from severely ill or lethally infected patients,
                  especially those from pregnant women and infants, were totally
                  benign for guinea-pigs. These data suggest that antigenically
                  distinct LV strains exist in nature, and that antigenically
                  indistinguishable LV isolates may differ in virulence
                  potential for various hosts.},

               sequence alignment. It can deal with very large numbers (many
               tens of thousands) of DNA/RNA or protein sequences due to its use
               of the mBed algorithm for calculating guide-trees. This algorithm
               allows very large alignment problems to be tackled very quickly,
               even on personal computers. The accuracy of the program has been
               considerably improved over earlier Clustal programs, through the
               use of the HHalign method for aligning profile hidden Markov
               models. The program currently is used from the command-line or
               can be run online.},

                  decades on ART and viremia returns if ART is stopped.
                  Persistence has been attributed to viral replication in an ART
                  sanctuary and long-lived and/or proliferating latently
                  infected cells. Using ecological methods and existing data, we

                  populations after one year of ART. We reconcile our results
                  with observations from the first months of ART, demonstrating
                  mathematically how a fossil record of historic HIV replication
                  permits observed viral evolution even while most new infected
                  cells arise from proliferation. Together, our results imply
                  cellular proliferation generates a majority of infected cells

                  the size of the HIV reservoir and help achieve a functional

                  viral suppression in HIV-positive individuals. Drug resistant
                  HIV variants, including minority variants, can compromise
                  response to antiretroviral therapy. Many studies have
                  investigated the clinical relevance of drug resistant minority
                  variants, but the level at which minority variants become
                  clinically relevant remains unclear. A combination of
                  Primer-ID and deep sequencing is a promising approach that may
                  quantify minority variants more accurately compared to
                  standard deep sequencing. However, most studies that used the
                  Primer-ID method have analyzed clinical samples directly.
                  Thus, its sensitivity and quantitative accuracy have not been
                  adequately validated using known controls. Here, we
                  constructed defined proportions of artificial RNA and virus
                  quasispecies and measured their relative proportions using the
                  Primer-ID based, quantitative single-variant sequencing (qSVS)

                  1\% of quasispecies were detected reproducibly with minimal
                  variations between technical replicates. In addition, the
                  measured frequencies were comparable to the expected
                  frequencies. These data validate the accuracy and
                  reproducibility of the qSVS assay in quantifying authentic HIV
                  minority variants, and support the use of this approach to
                  examine the impacts of minority HIV variants on virologic

                  in North Kivu Province, DRC. Participants provided

                  demographics for associations with follow-up antibody titers
                  using generalized linear mixed models. A majority of the

                  95.6\% demonstrated antibody persistence at visit 3. Being

                  Major challenges in developing a Lassa virus vaccine include
                  the high diversity of circulating strains and their
                  reemergence from 1 year to another. To address each of these

                  inference framework under a general Gaussian trait evolution
                  model that exploits Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (HMC). HMC enables
                  efficient sampling of the constrained model parameters and
                  takes advantage of the tree structure for fast likelihood and
                  gradient computations, yielding algorithmic complexity linear

                  Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) process, with possible missing data

                  been steadily expanding, only a tiny fraction of the Earth's
                  virome has been sequenced so far. Shotgun metagenomic
                  sequencing provides an opportunity to reveal novel viruses but
                  faces the computational challenge of identifying viral genomes
                  that are often difficult to detect in metagenomic assemblies.
                  RESULTS: We describe a MetaviralSPAdes tool for identifying
                  viral genomes in metagenomic assembly graphs that is based on
                  analyzing variations in the coverage depth between viruses and
                  bacterial chromosomes. We benchmarked MetaviralSPAdes on
                  diverse metagenomic datasets, verified our predictions using a
                  set of virus-specific Hidden Markov Models and demonstrated
                  that it improves on the state-of-the-art viral identification

                  existing viruses have been discovered, naturally much less
                  being represented in the genomic databases. High-throughput
                  sequencing technologies develop rapidly, empowering
                  large-scale screening of various biological samples for the
                  presence of pathogen-associated nucleotide sequences, but many
                  organisms are yet to be attributed specific loci for
                  identification. This problem particularly impedes viral
                  screening, due to vast heterogeneity in viral genomes. In this
                  paper, we present a new bioinformatic pipeline, VirIdAl, for
                  detecting and identifying viral pathogens in sequencing data.
                  We also demonstrate the utility of the new software by
                  applying it to viral screening of the feces of bats collected
                  in the Moscow region, which revealed a significant variety of
                  viruses associated with bats, insects, plants, and protozoa.
                  The presence of alpha and beta coronavirus reads, including
                  the MERS-like bat virus, deserves a special mention, as it
                  once again indicates that bats are indeed reservoirs for many
                  viral pathogens. In addition, it was shown that
                  alignment-based methods were unable to identify the taxon for
                  a large proportion of reads, and we additionally applied other
                  approaches, showing that they can further reveal the presence
                  of viral agents in sequencing data. However, the
                  incompleteness of viral databases remains a significant
                  problem in the studies of viral diversity, and therefore
                  necessitates the use of combined approaches, including those
                  based on machine learning methods.},

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: VSEARCH is an open source and free of charge
                  multithreaded 64-bit tool for processing and preparing
                  metagenomics, genomics and population genomics nucleotide
                  sequence data. It is designed as an alternative to the widely
                  used USEARCH tool (Edgar, 2010) for which the source code is
                  not publicly available, algorithm details are only
                  rudimentarily described, and only a memory-confined 32-bit
                  version is freely available for academic use. METHODS: When
                  searching nucleotide sequences, VSEARCH uses a fast heuristic
                  based on words shared by the query and target sequences in
                  order to quickly identify similar sequences, a similar
                  strategy is probably used in USEARCH. VSEARCH then performs
                  optimal global sequence alignment of the query against
                  potential target sequences, using full dynamic programming
                  instead of the seed-and-extend heuristic used by USEARCH.
                  Pairwise alignments are computed in parallel using
                  vectorisation and multiple threads. RESULTS: VSEARCH includes
                  most commands for analysing nucleotide sequences available in
                  USEARCH version 7 and several of those available in USEARCH
                  version 8, including searching (exact or based on global
                  alignment), clustering by similarity (using length
                  pre-sorting, abundance pre-sorting or a user-defined order),
                  chimera detection (reference-based or de novo), dereplication
                  (full length or prefix), pairwise alignment, reverse
                  complementation, sorting, and subsampling. VSEARCH also
                  includes commands for FASTQ file processing, i.e., format
                  detection, filtering, read quality statistics, and merging of
                  paired reads. Furthermore, VSEARCH extends functionality with
                  several new commands and improvements, including shuffling,
                  rereplication, masking of low-complexity sequences with the
                  well-known DUST algorithm, a choice among different similarity
                  definitions, and FASTQ file format conversion. VSEARCH is here
                  shown to be more accurate than USEARCH when performing
                  searching, clustering, chimera detection and subsampling,
                  while on a par with USEARCH for paired-ends read merging.
                  VSEARCH is slower than USEARCH when performing clustering and
                  chimera detection, but significantly faster when performing
                  paired-end reads merging and dereplication. VSEARCH is
                  available at https://github.com/torognes/vsearch under either
                  the BSD 2-clause license or the GNU General Public License
                  version 3.0. DISCUSSION: VSEARCH has been shown to be a fast,
                  accurate and full-fledged alternative to USEARCH. A free and
                  open-source versatile tool for sequence analysis is now
                  available to the metagenomics community.},

                  metagenome and transcriptome assemblers often are not able to
                  assemble many viruses (including coronaviruses) into a single
                  contig. Coverage variation between datasets and within
                  dataset, presence of close strains, splice variants and
                  contamination set a high bar for assemblers to process viral
                  datasets with diverse properties. RESULTS: We developed
                  coronaSPAdes, a novel assembler for RNA viral species recovery
                  in general and coronaviruses in particular. coronaSPAdes
                  leverages the knowledge about viral genome structures to
                  improve assembly extending ideas initially implemented in
                  biosyntheticSPAdes. We have shown that coronaSPAdes
                  outperforms existing SPAdes modes and other popular short-read
                  metagenome and viral assemblers in the recovery of full-length

               ranging from mild flu-like symptoms to bleeding disorders,
               multi-organ failure, and death. Despite some major discoveries
               made in recent years of research on Lassa fever, there are still
               many unresolved key issues that hamper the development of
               effective vaccines and therapies. Some of these issues include a
               detailed understanding of the viral and participating host

               pathogenesis or protection, and in activating or suppressing host

                  methods to manage HTS generated data in this field. Thus, we
                  developed LABRADOR-an analysis pipeline for adventitious virus
                  detection. The pipeline consists of several third-party
                  programs and is divided into two major parts: (i) direct reads
                  classification based on the comparison of characteristic

                  supported with alignment of to the best matching reference

  abstract     = {Human cytomegalovirus (HCMV), like other herpes and dsDNA
                  viruses, possesses unique properties derived from their genome
                  architecture. The HCMV genome is composed of two unique
                  domains: long (L) and short (S). Each domain contains a
                  central unique region (U; thus, UL and US, respectively) and
                  two repeated regions (thus, TRL/IRL and TRS/IRS).
                  Recombination between repetitive regions is possible, yielding
                  four possible genomic isomers, found in equimolar proportion
                  in any viral infective population. Frequent recombination and
                  an altered selective landscape can give rise to the
                  persistence, if not fixation, of diverse variants in
                  culturized HCMV isolates. This phenomenon has already been
                  discovered in AD169 and Towne strains, characterizing a 10 kbp
                  deletion (ΔUL/b’) in commonly used viral strains. Other dsDNA
                  viruses are known for their structural rearrangements and
                  frequent recombination. VANIR (viral variant calling and de
                  novo assembly using nanopore and illumina reads) is a novel
                  analysis pipeline that benefits from both short-read
                  (Illumina) and long-read sequencing technologies (Oxford
                  Nanopore Technologies Ltd.) to assemble high-quality dsDNA
                  viral genomes and detection of variants. Illumina and nanopore
                  sequencing provide complementary information to the assembly
                  and variant discovery. Assembly contiguity, structural
                  variant, and repeat calling are greatly improved by nanopore
                  read-length and base-calling and base confidence by Illumina
                  reduced error rate and increased yield. This specialized
                  bioinformatic analysis pipeline is encoded in the NextFlow
                  pipeline manager and containerized in a Singularity image.
                  This set-up allows for improved traceability, reproducibility,
                  transportability, and speed. Through VANIR, novel point
                  mutations and structural genome rearrangements are called from
                  sequencing data, benefiting diversity research with attenuated

                  low-frequency viral variants and sub-populations with greater
                  accuracy and sensitivity than ever before. Existing platforms
                  can be used to multiplex a large number of samples; however,
                  analysis of the resulting data is complex and involves
                  separating barcoded samples and various read manipulation
                  processes ending in final assembly. Many assembly tools were
                  designed with larger genomes and higher fidelity polymerases
                  in mind and do not perform well with reads derived from highly
                  variable viral genomes. Reference-based assemblers may leave
                  gaps in viral assemblies while de novo assemblers may struggle
                  to assemble unique genomes. RESULTS: The IRMA (iterative
                  refinement meta-assembler) pipeline solves the problem of
                  viral variation by the iterative optimization of read
                  gathering and assembly. As with all reference-based assembly,
                  reads are included in assembly when they match consensus
                  template sets; however, IRMA provides for on-the-fly reference
                  editing, correction, and optional elongation without the need
                  for additional reference selection. This increases both read
                  depth and breadth. IRMA also focuses on quality control, error
                  correction, indel reporting, variant calling and variant
                  phasing. In fact, IRMA's ability to detect and phase minor
                  variants is one of its most distinguishing features. We have
                  built modules for influenza and ebolavirus. We demonstrate
                  usage and provide calibration data from mixture experiments.
                  Methods for variant calling, phasing, and error
                  estimation/correction have been redesigned to meet the needs
                  of viral genomic sequencing. CONCLUSION: IRMA provides a
                  robust next-generation sequencing assembly solution that is
                  adapted to the needs and characteristics of viral genomes. The
                  software solves issues related to the genetic diversity of
                  viruses while providing customized variant calling, phasing,
                  and quality control. IRMA is freely available for

                  sequencing throughput. While the high-coverage afforded can be
                  used, in principle, to identify very rare variants in a

                  and aligning them to each other. It remains difficult,
                  however, to compare modern multi-billionbase DNA data sets.
                  The difficulty is caused by the nonuniform (oligo)nucleotide
                  composition of these sequences, rather than their size per se.
                  To solve this problem, we modified the standard
                  seed-and-extend approach (e.g., BLAST) to use adaptive seeds.
                  Adaptive seeds are matches that are chosen based on their
                  rareness, instead of using fixed-length matches. This method
                  guarantees that the number of matches, and thus the running
                  time, increases linearly, instead of quadratically, with
                  sequence length. LAST, our open source implementation of
                  adaptive seeds, enables fast and sensitive comparison of large

  abstract     = {BACKGROUND: The Smith-Waterman algorithm, which produces the
                  optimal pairwise alignment between two sequences, is
                  frequently used as a key component of fast heuristic read
                  mapping and variation detection tools for next-generation
                  sequencing data. Though various fast Smith-Waterman
                  implementations are developed, they are either designed as
                  monolithic protein database searching tools, which do not
                  return detailed alignment, or are embedded into other tools.
                  These issues make reusing these efficient Smith-Waterman
                  implementations impractical. RESULTS: To facilitate easy
                  integration of the fast Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data
                  Smith-Waterman algorithm into third-party software, we wrote a
                  C/C++ library, which extends Farrar's Striped Smith-Waterman
                  (SSW) to return alignment information in addition to the
                  optimal Smith-Waterman score. In this library we developed a
                  new method to generate the full optimal alignment results and
                  a suboptimal score in linear space at little cost of
                  efficiency. This improvement makes the fast
                  Single-Instruction-Multiple-Data Smith-Waterman become really
                  useful in genomic applications. SSW is available both as a
                  C/C++ software library, as well as a stand-alone alignment
                  tool at:
                  https://github.com/mengyao/Complete-Striped-Smith-Waterman-Library.
                  CONCLUSIONS: The SSW library has been used in the primary read
                  mapping tool MOSAIK, the split-read mapping program SCISSORS,
                  the MEI detector TANGRAM, and the read-overlap graph
                  generation program RZMBLR. The speeds of the mentioned
                  software are improved significantly by replacing their
                  ordinary Smith-Waterman or banded Smith-Waterman module with
                  the SSW Library.},

                  diversity and impact these biological entities have on a range
                  of different ecosystems. These observations have sparked
                  widespread interest in developing computational strategies
                  that support the comprehensive characterization of viral
                  communities based on sequencing data. Here we introduce
                  VIRify, a new computational pipeline designed to provide a
                  user-friendly and accurate functional and taxonomic
                  characterization of viral communities. VIRify identifies viral
                  contigs and prophages from metagenomic assemblies and
                  annotates them using a collection of viral profile hidden
                  Markov models (HMMs). These include our manually-curated
                  profile HMMs, which serve as specific taxonomic markers for a
                  wide range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic viral taxa and are
                  thus used to reliably classify viral contigs. We tested VIRify
                  on assemblies from two microbial mock communities and a large
                  metagenomics study. The results showed that VIRify was able to
                  identify sequences from both prokaryotic and eukaryotic
                  viruses, and provided taxonomic classifications from the genus
                  to the family rank with an accuracy of at least 95.5\%. In
                  addition, VIRify allowed the detection and taxonomic
                  classification of a range of prokaryotic and eukaryotic
                  viruses present in 243 marine metagenomic assemblies. Overall,
                  we demonstrate that VIRify is a novel and powerful resource
                  that offers an enhanced capability to detect a broad range of
                  viral contigs and taxonomically classify them. \#\#\#

                  possibility of revolutionizing the study of viral populations
                  by providing ultra deep sequencing (tens to hundreds of
                  thousand fold coverage) of complete viral genomes. However,
                  differentiation of true low frequency variants from sequencing
                  errors remains challenging. RESULTS: We developed a software
                  package, V-Phaser 2, for inferring intrahost diversity within
                  viral populations. This program adds three major new
                  methodologies to the state of the art: a technique to
                  efficiently utilize paired end read data for calling phased
                  variants, a new strategy to represent and infer length
                  polymorphisms, and an in line filter for erroneous calls
                  arising from systematic sequencing artifacts. We have also
                  heavily optimized memory and run time performance. This
                  combination of algorithmic and technical advances allows
                  V-Phaser 2 to fully utilize extremely deep paired end
                  sequencing data (such as generated by Illumina sequencers) to
                  accurately infer low frequency intrahost variants in viral
                  populations in reasonable time on a standard desktop computer.
                  V-Phaser 2 was validated and compared to both QuRe and the
                  original V-Phaser on three datasets obtained from two viral
                  populations: a mixture of eight known strains of West Nile
                  Virus (WNV) sequenced on both 454 Titanium and Illumina MiSeq
                  and a mixture of twenty-four known strains of WNV sequenced
                  only on 454 Titanium. V-Phaser 2 outperformed the other two
                  programs in both sensitivity and specificity while using more
                  than five fold less time and memory. CONCLUSIONS: We developed
                  V-Phaser 2, a publicly available software tool (V-Phaser 2 can

  abstract     = {INTRODUCTION: Metagenomic sequencing is increasingly being
                  used in clinical settings for difficult to diagnose cases. The
                  performance of viral metagenomic protocols relies to a large
                  extent on the bioinformatic analysis. In this study, the
                  European Society for Clinical Virology (ESCV) Network on NGS
                  (ENNGS) initiated a benchmark of metagenomic pipelines
                  currently used in clinical virological laboratories. METHODS:
                  Metagenomic datasets from 13 clinical samples from patients
                  with encephalitis or viral respiratory infections
                  characterized by PCR were selected. The datasets were analyzed
                  with 13 different pipelines currently used in virological
                  diagnostic laboratories of participating ENNGS members. The
                  pipelines and classification tools were: Centrifuge, DAMIAN,
                  DIAMOND, DNASTAR, FEVIR, Genome Detective, Jovian, MetaMIC,
                  MetaMix, One Codex, RIEMS, VirMet, and Taxonomer. Performance,
                  characteristics, clinical use, and user-friendliness of these
                  pipelines were analyzed. RESULTS: Overall, viral pathogens
                  with high loads were detected by all the evaluated metagenomic
                  pipelines. In contrast, lower abundance pathogens and mixed
                  infections were only detected by 3/13 pipelines, namely
                  DNASTAR, FEVIR, and MetaMix. Overall sensitivity ranged from
                  80\% (10/13) to 100\% (13/13 datasets). Overall positive
                  predictive value ranged from 71-100\%. The majority of the
                  pipelines classified sequences based on nucleotide similarity
                  (8/13), only a minority used amino acid similarity, and 6 of
                  the 13 pipelines assembled sequences de novo. No clear
                  differences in performance were detected that correlated with
                  these classification approaches. Read counts of target viruses
                  varied between the pipelines over a range of 2-3 log,
                  indicating differences in limit of detection. CONCLUSION: A
                  wide variety of viral metagenomic pipelines is currently used
                  in the participating clinical diagnostic laboratories.
                  Detection of low abundant viral pathogens and mixed infections
                  remains a challenge, implicating the need for standardization
                  and validation of metagenomic analysis for clinical diagnostic
                  use. Future studies should address the selective effects due
                  to the choice of different reference viral databases.},

                  dataset to be accurate. Virosaurus has been designed to offer
                  a non-biased, automatized and annotated database for clinical
                  metagenomics studies and diagnosis. Raw viral sequences have
                  been extracted from GenBank, and cleaned up to remove
                  potentially erroneous sequences. Complete sequences have been
                  identified for all genera infecting vertebrates, plants and
                  other eukaryotes (insect, fungus, etc.). To facilitate the
                  analysis of clinically relevant viruses, we have annotated all
                  sequences with official and common virus names, acronym,
                  genotypes, and genomic features (linear, circular, DNA, RNA,
                  etc.). Sequences have been clustered to remove redundancy at
                  90\% or 98\% identity. The analysis of clustering results
                  reveals the state of the virus genetic landscape knowledge.
                  Because herpes and poxviruses were under-represented in
                  complete genomes considering their potential diversity in
                  nature, we used genes instead of complete genomes for those in

  abstract     = {Detection of distantly related viruses by high-throughput
                  sequencing (HTS) is bioinformatically challenging because of
                  the lack of a public database containing all viral sequences,
                  without abundant nonviral sequences, which can extend runtime
                  and obscure viral hits. Our reference viral database (RVDB)
                  includes all viral, virus-related, and virus-like nucleotide
                  sequences (excluding bacterial viruses), regardless of length,
                  and with overall reduced cellular sequences. Semantic
                  selection criteria (SEM-I) were used to select viral sequences
                  from GenBank, resulting in a first-generation viral database
                  (VDB). This database was manually and computationally
                  reviewed, resulting in refined, semantic selection criteria
                  (SEM-R), which were applied to a new download of updated
                  GenBank sequences to create a second-generation VDB. Viral
                  entries in the latter were clustered at 98\% by CD-HIT-EST to
                  reduce redundancy while retaining high viral sequence
                  diversity. The viral identity of the clustered representative
                  sequences (creps) was confirmed by BLAST searches in NCBI
                  databases and HMMER searches in PFAM and DFAM databases. The
                  resulting RVDB contained a broad representation of viral
                  families, sequence diversity, and a reduced cellular content;
                  it includes full-length and partial sequences and endogenous
                  nonretroviral elements, endogenous retroviruses, and
                  retrotransposons. Testing of RVDBv10.2, with an in-house HTS
                  transcriptomic data set indicated a significantly faster run
                  for virus detection than interrogating the entirety of the
                  NCBI nonredundant nucleotide database, which contains all
                  viral sequences but also nonviral sequences. RVDB is
                  publically available for facilitating HTS analysis,
                  particularly for novel virus detection. It is meant to be
                  updated on a regular basis to include new viral sequences
                  added to GenBank. IMPORTANCE To facilitate bioinformatics
                  analysis of high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data for the
                  detection of both known and novel viruses, we have developed a
                  new reference viral database (RVDB) that provides a broad
                  representation of different virus species from eukaryotes by
                  including all viral, virus-like, and virus-related sequences
                  (excluding bacteriophages), regardless of their size. In
                  particular, RVDB contains endogenous nonretroviral elements,
                  endogenous retroviruses, and retrotransposons. Sequences were
                  clustered to reduce redundancy while retaining high viral
                  sequence diversity. A particularly useful feature of RVDB is
                  the reduction of cellular sequences, which can enhance the run
                  efficiency of large transcriptomic and genomic data analysis
                  and increase the specificity of virus detection.},

                  profiles, broadly referred to as metagenomic profilers, have
                  been developed. Nevertheless, benchmarking of metagenomic
                  profilers remains challenging because some tools are designed
                  to report relative sequence abundance while others report
                  relative taxonomic abundance. Here we show how misleading
                  conclusions can be drawn by neglecting this distinction
                  between relative abundance types when benchmarking metagenomic
                  profilers. Moreover, we show compelling evidence that
                  interchanging sequence abundance and taxonomic abundance will
                  influence both per-sample summary statistics and cross-sample
                  comparisons. We suggest that the microbiome research community
                  pay attention to potentially misleading biological conclusions
                  arising from this issue when benchmarking metagenomic
                  profilers, by carefully considering the type of abundance data

                  exposure in 2 ecologically diverse regions of Guinea. Our
                  results showed that exposure to LASV was heterogenous between
                  and within sites. LASV IgG seropositivity was 11.9\% (95\% CI

                  organism-specific metabolic pathways and reconstruct community
                  interaction networks. This requires accurate assignment of
                  assembled genome fragments to genomes. Existing binning
                  methods often fail to reconstruct a reasonable number of
                  genomes and report many bins of low quality and completeness.
                  Furthermore, the performance of existing algorithms varies
                  between samples and biotopes. Here, we present a

                  microbial species. MetaBAT has become one of the most popular
                  binning tools largely due to its computational efficiency and
                  ease of use, especially in binning experiments with a large
                  number of samples and a large assembly. MetaBAT requires users
                  to choose parameters to fine-tune its sensitivity and
                  specificity. If those parameters are not chosen properly,
                  binning accuracy can suffer, especially on assemblies of poor
                  quality. Here, we developed MetaBAT 2 to overcome this
                  problem. MetaBAT 2 uses a new adaptive binning algorithm to
                  eliminate manual parameter tuning. We also performed extensive
                  software engineering optimization to increase both

                  alternative software tools on over 100 real world metagenome
                  assemblies shows superior accuracy and computing speed.
